Today's the day of your reckoning, fiend!
*RRRAGH*
Heh... Heheheheh... To think that this is how I fall...
Well, all things considered, at least the one to kill me is one of my brood.
What? I'm no demon-spawn, you foul creature!
Oh, but you are. Or did you think all that strength comes from your righteousness?
Look into yourself, and you'll see that I'm not lying. It's not like there's any need to, anymore.
SILENCE!
*ARGH*
That aura... There is no mistaking it. You reek of the underworld.
For one with little to no magic prowess, you are quite astute, BIG_KNIGHT.
Indeed, it seems that our proud leader might have a couple skeletons in the closet.
*RAAAAAGH*
Now-now, I'm not one ta talk, but our goody two shoes leader might not be so squeaky clean after all.
No way... And I thought we finally got rid of this vile corruption.
Well, apparently not...
Surely you mean not YET. It doesn't look like it's too late to fix our... error.
What are you suggesting, Wizard? Are you out of your mind?
Oh no, in fact, I think my thoughts have never been so clear.
This demon filth destroyed my home! If all it takes is one last sacrifice, then so be it.
Heh, sorry chief, but I never liked ya anyway. If you're gone I'm gonna get more glory, so I'm willing to overlook a little accident.
You bloody cowards, how could you do this? And after all that we've been through together!
*RAAAAAAAAAGH*
I for one will not wait until this creature gets completely consumed by the miasma. Kill it!
Aye-aye!
Hmph, good riddance.
